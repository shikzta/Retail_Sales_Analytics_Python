# Source Code Folder

This directory is reserved for Python scripts used in modularizing the analysis
(e.g., utility functions, data cleaning functions, or report generators).

For this version of the project, all analysis is inside the Jupyter notebook.
Future iterations will move reusable functions into this folder.
